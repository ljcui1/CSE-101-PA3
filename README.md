## README.md
> This markdown file gives a general summary of all of the files made by Lia Cui.

## Makefile
> This make file is a script used to compile the c codes and check the executable file.

## FindComponents.c
> This c file contains code to take in an input and output file for the program to take in Graph information (ie. vertices, edges and arcs) and print out the adjacency list representation of the graph and the strongly connected components. The input and output file system base is from Patrick Tantalo's FileIO code.

## List.c
> This c file contains code that builds the List ADT in the form of a doubly linked list with a cursor element. The file contains constructor and destructor functions as well as various access and data manipulation functions.

## List.h
> This is the header file containing the functions from List.c.

## Graph.c
> This c file contains code that builds the Graph structure in the form of an adjacency list with defining features acknowledging the vertices, edges and arcs. The file contains constructor and destructor functions as well as various access and data manipulation functions. Vertex neighbors are discovered using a Depth First Search method implemented as a function in this file.

## Graph.h
> This is the header file containing the functions from Graph.c.

## GraphTest.c
> This c file contains code used to test the functionality of every function in the Graph.c file. The test code and format base is from Patrick Tantalo's GraphClient code.
